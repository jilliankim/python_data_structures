Unlike Java, Python Lists can store different data types.  
It's an ordered sequence of *heterogenous* elements.  

    # this is totally okay in python!
    sample_list = ['example', 1, 2, 4.15]
    # in java, you'd have the type declared for the list
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
    list.add("hello");
    list.add(4.15) //error!!!
